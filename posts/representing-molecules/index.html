Then the connection between two atoms is shown by an adjacency matrix like the one below. Where index i, j of the matrix is 0 when there is no bond between the atoms i and j and 1 if there is a bond.\n[ [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] ] Graph as an adjacency list As you saw above, an adjacency matrix is not a good representation because most of the members are 0. This is called a sparse matrix. A better way to represent a sparse adjacency matrix is using adjacency lists.\nFor example, the above matrix can be represented using a single array.\n[[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [7, 10], [10, 11], [10, 12], [12, 13], [12, 14], [9, 4]] This list is a list of bonds. Each member shows a bond between two atoms. For example, the first member [0, 1] shows there is a connection between the 0th and 1st atom. As you can see in the above image that is indeed true.\nThe main problem with the Graph representations is that the information indicating the kind of the bond (Single, Double, etc.) is lost.\nLater we will show how to avoid losing that information.\n","wordCount":"559","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-05T15:16:22+04:30","dateModified":"2022-08-05T15:16:22+04:30","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://athecoder.github.io/posts/representing-molecules/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Arash","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://athecoder.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://athecoder.github.io accesskey=h title="Arash (Alt + H)">Arash</a>
