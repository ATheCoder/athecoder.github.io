Few shot learning is useful when there are many different related Tasks but data for each one of them is lacking.
To give an example:
There is branch of science called Math. But there are different subject areas of Math. In order to learn Math you have to learn the different subject areas. For example one might imagine that a person who knows how to do multiplication will have an easier time learning derivatives than a person who does not know how to do multiplication.</description></item><item><title>Combinatorics</title><link>https://athecoder.github.io/posts/combinatorics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 22:59:38 +0330</pubDate><guid>https://athecoder.github.io/posts/combinatorics/</guid><description>I remember the first days that I entered high school, I was registered at a high school that specialized in sending students to national scientific olympiads and since I was very fond of my love of computers I wanted to participate in the computer national olympiad.
However, this dream soon went into dust when I was first introduced to combinatorics. I had never seen a subject as vague as combinatorics. So many symbols and new operations.</description></item></channel></rss>
