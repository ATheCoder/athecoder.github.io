I remember the first days that I entered high school, I was registered at a high school that specialized in sending students to national scientific olympiads and since I was very fond of my love of computers I wanted to participate in the computer national olympiad.  

However, this dream soon went into dust when I was first introduced to **combinatorics**. I had never seen a subject as vague as combinatorics. So many symbols and new operations. I didn't even know what an operation was at that time but I remember exactly what I was thinking:

> "Aren't computers about code?"

> "I thought this was a computer olympiad not a math olympiad"

> "What the hell is the combination of K from N?"

Now it has been, about 10 years since I had that combinatorics course and I'm pursuing my master degree of Artificial Intelligence and you know what is one of the fundamental courses that Machine learning is built upon? Yep you guessed it, It's combinatorics.  

Who would have thought that the least attended to course in my high school was actually the most important subject that you had to use in order to [make computers conscious!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqbB07n_uQ4)
